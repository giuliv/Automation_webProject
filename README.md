# template.web.auto

The simple scenario was automated. 

I enjoyed the annotation-driven way of coding and the flexible configuration opportunities. 

The main fuctions of framework was pretty clear but I didn't find out how to get the list of elements such as driver.findElements with Selenium.
I also had to hardcode the path to the local driver. I'm suppose there's a more elegant way to implement this.
